# CARFL_Anomaly_Detection

We have proposed a Federated Learning (FL) scheme, dubbed CARFL (Clustered Adaptive Ring Federated Learning), which integrates clustered FL with an adaptive ring topology and an efficient model split mechanism to handle client heterogeneity while preserving data privacy through blended model updates.
